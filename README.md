# Key Level Forex Software

This code is developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team [^1^]. It is designed to implement the Price Retracement/Breakout Method algorithm and provide the necessary trading functions for the Key Level Forex Software.

## Description

The Key Level Forex Software is a trading tool that utilizes key levels in the market to identify potential entry points for trades. It calculates price retracement and breakout levels based on a predefined key level and certain thresholds. The software then checks for potential buy and sell entry points based on the current price compared to these levels.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this code is as follows:

1. Initialize the expert advisor by calling the `OnInit` function. It displays the key level entry points by calling the `DisplayKeyLevelEntryPoints` function.

2. On each tick, the expert advisor calls the `OnTick` function to check for potential entry points and trading opportunities.

3. The `CheckEntryPoints` function calculates the current price and checks if it is within the defined buy or sell entry points based on the key level and breakout threshold.

4. If a potential buy entry point is identified, the `OpenBuyPosition` function is called to open a buy position with a volume of 0.1 lots.

5. If a potential sell entry point is identified, the `OpenSellPosition` function is called to open a sell position with a volume of 0.1 lots.

6. The `OnDeinit` function is called during deinitialization to close all existing positions.

## Constants

The following constants are defined in the code:

- `KEY_LEVEL`: The predefined key level used to calculate entry points.
- `RETRACEMENT_PERCENTAGE`: The percentage used to calculate the retracement levels.
- `BREAKOUT_THRESHOLD`: The threshold used to calculate the breakout levels.

## Functions

The code includes the following functions:

- `OnInit`: The initialization function of the expert advisor. It calls the `DisplayKeyLevelEntryPoints` function and returns `INIT_SUCCEEDED`.
- `OnDeinit`: The deinitialization function of the expert advisor. It closes all existing positions.
- `OnTick`: The tick function of the expert advisor. It checks for potential entry points and trading opportunities.
- `DisplayKeyLevelEntryPoints`: A function to calculate and display the key level entry points on the chart.
- `CheckEntryPoints`: A function to check for potential entry points and trading opportunities based on the current price.
- `OpenBuyPosition`: A function to open a buy position if there is no existing position.
- `OpenSellPosition`: A function to open a sell position if there is no existing position.
- `CloseAllPositions`: A function to close all existing positions.

## Usage

To use this code, simply include the necessary libraries and define the key level constants. Then, initialize the expert advisor by calling the `OnInit` function. The expert advisor will continuously check for potential entry points and trading opportunities on each tick.
